# ArgentBank - User Authentication

Welcome to the user authentication project for SArgentBankportify. This phase of the project aims to create a complete and responsive web application using React, using Redux to manage the state of the entire application.

## Introduction

This project involves developing user authentication for ArgentBank using React and Redux. The goal is to allow users to log in to the system, log out, and access their profile once logged in.

## Getting started !

### Prerequisites

Argent Bank uses the following tech stack:

- [Node.js v21.1.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Instructions Back-End

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Project-10-Bank-API)
1. Clone the repo into your computer
1. Open a terminal window in the cloned project
1. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server
npm run dev:server

# Populate database with two users
npm run populate-db
```

Your server should now be running at http://locahost:3001 and you will now have two users in your MongoDB database!

### Populated Database Data

Once you run the `populate-db` script, you should have two users in your database:

### Tony Stark

- First Name: `Tony`
- Last Name: `Stark`
- Email: `tony@stark.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Steve Rogers

- First Name: `Steve`,
- Last Name: `Rogers`,
- Email: `steve@rogers.com`,
- Password: `password456`
